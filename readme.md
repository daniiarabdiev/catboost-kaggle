# Catboost-Kaggle Workshop

## Object Importance

In the notebook, ObjectImportance.ipynb you can find code for finding object importance for each example in the training set, in order to find faulty or weak examples. 


## Denoising AutoEncoders + GB

In the notebook, DenoiseAutoEncoder+Catbooost.ipynb you can find code for combining latent space generated by Denoising AutoEncoders with Gradient Boosting algorithm in this case (Catboost.)

## Catboost

In the notebook, catboost_masterclass.ipynb you can find code for training catboost model using cross validation and out of fold predictions as well as features like summation of models.
